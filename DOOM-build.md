## Introduction

Here's a recommended build for **DOOM: The Dark Ages**, based on the required specs. I put this together to figure out where my money's best spent, spot any upgrade bottlenecks, and get a rough idea of the budget before any discounts kick in. It’s a demanding game, so solid hardware is a must for smooth performance.


## ⚠️ Game Requirements

Based on the official DOOM: The Dark Ages specifications, there are three tiers of hardware requirements:



| Category | 😐 Minimum | 😎 Recommended | 🤯 Ultra 4K |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Player Experience | 1080p/60 FPS (Low settings) | 1440p/60 FPS (High settings) | 2160p/60 FPS (Ultra settings) |
| OS | Win10/11 64-bit | Win10/11 64-bit | Win10/11 64-bit |
| CPU | AMD Zen 2 or Intel 10th Gen<br>@3.2GHz with 8 cores/16 threads | AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Gen<br>@3.2GHz with 8 cores/16 threads | AMD Zen 3 or Intel 12th Gen<br>@3.2GHz with 8 cores/16 threads |
| GPU | Ray tracing-capable with 8GB VRAM<br>(RTX 2060 SUPER or RX 6600) | Ray tracing-capable with 10GB VRAM<br>(RTX 3080 or RX 6800) | Ray tracing-capable with 16GB VRAM<br>(RTX 4080 or RX 7900XT) |
| RAM | 16GB | 32GB | 32GB |
| Storage | 512GB NVMe SSD (100GB available) | 512GB NVMe SSD (100GB available) | 512GB NVMe SSD (100GB available) |

## ⚔️ Hardware Analysis

### 🧠 CPU Comparison

The build considers two AMD Ryzen CPUs:

| Feature | Ryzen 7 5700X | Ryzen 7 7700X | Advantage |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Architecture | Zen 3 | Zen 4 | 7700X |
| Cores/Threads | 8/16 | 8/16 | Equal |
| Base Clock | 3.4 GHz | 4.5 GHz | 7700X |
| Boost Clock | 4.6 GHz | 5.4 GHz | 7700X |
| Performance Gain | Baseline | +17% | 7700X |
| UserBenchmark Rank | 133rd/1405 | 54th/1405 | 7700X |
| Price | $235 | $409 | 5700X |
| Price/Performance | Better | - | 5700X |
| Socket | AM4 | AM5 | 7700X (future upgrades) |

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

**Analysis:** While the 7700X offers 17% better performance, the 5700X provides significantly better value. For DOOM's requirements, the 5700X meets the recommended (AMD Zen 3 with 8 cores/16 threads) at nearly half the cost of the 7700X. But the big con it's AM4 socket which makes it much less upgradable in the future.

### 🕹️ GPU Comparison

Comparing the RX 6800 with the RX 7800-XT:

| Feature | RX 6800 | RX 7800-XT | Advantage |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Architecture | RDNA 2 | RDNA 3 | 7800-XT |
| VRAM | 16GB | 16GB | Equal |
| Performance Gain | Baseline | +25% | 7800-XT |
| Release Date | Q4 2020 | Q3 2023 | 7800-XT (newer) |
| Ray Tracing | Yes | Enhanced | 7800-XT |
| UserBenchmark Effectiveness | 58 (1,329 benchmarks) | 58 (2,347 benchmarks) | Equal rating, more data for 7800-XT |
| Price (as shown) | $1,025 | Not listed | - |
| Current Market Price | ~$480-550 | ~$550-600 | 6800 |

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

**Analysis:** The RX 6800 is fully capable for the recommended requirements (ray tracing-capable GPU with 10GB VRAM) and actually exceeds them with its 16GB VRAM. The 7800-XT is 25% faster and costs more but, better bang for you buck when it comes to raw $ to frame. 

## 🖥 Recommended Build

Based on the analysis:

> 💡 **Note**: this is not considering if these parts are available or factoring any discount 


| Component | Item | Price (CAD) | Hell-ready Rating |
|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 7 5700X | $235.10 | 🔥🔥🔥 |
| CPU Cooler | Deepcool GAMMAXX AG400 ARGB | $29.99 | 🔥 |
| Motherboard | Asus TUF GAMING B650-E WIFI ATX AM5 | $249.99 | 🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| Memory | TEAMGROUP T-Force VULCAN 32GB DDR5-6000 | $124.99 | 🔥🔥🔥 |
| Storage | Samsung 990 Pro 1TB NVMe SSD | $144.95 | 🔥🔥 |
| GPU | XFX Speedster SWFT 319 RX 6800 16GB | $548.90 | 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 |
| Case | SAMA V40 ATX Mid Tower | $128.24 | 🔥🔥 |
| Power Supply | MSI MAG A650GL 650W 80+ Gold | $109.99 | 🔥🔥 |
| **TOTAL DAMAGE** |https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/y4LZPJ | **$1,572.15** | 💰💰💰💰 |

## 💰 Budget Considerations

This build's gonna set you back about $1,500 CAD, which is more than initial budget. What can we do?

- Could of used the Ryzen 5700X for $239 
- Might save $10-15 on each of the Case, Storage, and PSU with some deal hunting
- The motherboard is expensive at $250, and there are motherboards that go for cheaper at 189.99$. Though I would refrain from it as they are not AM5 supported boards for any future upgrades
- The AM5 motherboard + DDR5 RAM combo is not budget concious, but it's a solid platform for the coming years
- Could hunt for used GPU deals (but watch for ex-mining cards that have been through hell already!)

## 🔥 Conclusion

The recommended build provides an excellent balance between performance and value for DOOM: The Dark Ages. It actually exceeds the recommended specifications in several areas (16GB vs 10GB VRAM), ensuring perfectly smooth gameplay at 1080p with high settings.

The Ryzen 7 5700X and RX 6800 combination forms a solid foundation that should provide enjoyable gameplay without extra spending. Which sets a good baseline for my final build.

I will consider waiting for sales on components like the GPU or looking at bundle deals to further reduce the total cost.
